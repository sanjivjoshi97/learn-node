- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

As part of the execution:
1. foo(2) is called. Due to this 'foo' is logged.
2. setTimeout puts bar(2) in the queue.
3. baz() is called and 'baz' is logged.
4. foo(1) is called. Due to this 'foo' is again logged.
5. setTimeout puts bar(1) in the queue.
6. baz() is called and 'baz' is logged.
7. event pool polled causing first logged event to call logging '2 : bar'
8. event pool polled causing second logged event to call logging '1 : bar'
