- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
1. Async call to readfile happens, schedules it on event queue.
2. setTimeout is scheduled on to the queue.
3. setImmediate is scheduled on to the queue but with more priority than setTimeout.
4. readFile finishes, prints error.
5. immediate finishes to log
6. timeout finishes to log
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
1. No because immediate will still have precedence.
