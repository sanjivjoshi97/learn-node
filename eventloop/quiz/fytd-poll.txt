- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Steps of execution:
1. someAsyncOperation() is called
2. fs.readFile() is a non-blocking file operation which happens in the background.
3. foo() is called 'foo' is logged.
4. 'done' is logged.
5. event poll occurs, checking if readFile() finished and prints output, since /path/to/file is not the correct
filepath, 'Read Error' is logged.
