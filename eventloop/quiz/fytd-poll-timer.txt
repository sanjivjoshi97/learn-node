- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
1. someAsyncOperation is called. fs.readFile() is added to event queue.
2. setTimeout scheduled to be called back after 0ms.
3. After 95ms the file read completes. Callback is added to event queue.
4. Event queue polled, 'someAysncOperation' is logged.
5. After that the timeout function is called, logging delay that was scheduled.

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
The order will not change as no matter how bigger in terms of time that while loop gets, since the async call was first
in the event queue, it will execute first.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
Here its difficult to say as the order can change depending on other factors beyond the scope of this js. It really
depends on whether the file operation completed sooner.
